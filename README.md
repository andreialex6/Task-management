Developed a task management application using Python's tkinter library for the graphical interface and a terminal-based interface. The application allows users to view, add, update, and delete tasks. Tasks include descriptions, dates and times. The graphical interface offers intuitive buttons and entry fields, while the terminal interface provides a menu-driven interaction. Tasks are serialized using the pickle module to persist data between program executions.

If you want to run the application, type make run.
You also have a clean rule in makefile: make clean.
